               <h2>A new report shows</h2>
               <p>
                    In the rapidly warming Antarctic, two species of penguins are in dramatic
                    decline.<br><br>
                    That’s the news out of a new study published by Oceanites, a nonprofit
                    organization that closely monitors penguins and other <span style="color:red">Antarctic seabirds</span>, in
                    collaboration with researchers from NASA and Stony Brook University in
                    New York.<br><br>
                    Relying on satellite photos and on-the-ground analysis from more than 660
                    sites across the frozen continent, the study paints a broad picture of the health
                    of several Antarctic penguin species: the Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, and
                    gentoo. Like endangered <a style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear"> polar bears,</a> penguins have come to represent
                    vulnerability in the face of rapidly unfolding <a href="https://www.ciwf.org.uk/factory-farming/environmental-damage/?gclid=CjwKCAjwwo7cBRBwEiwAMEoXPPQXE1_J1tO-07TlGm_r38iE03qC46KCwEizAuzflzLniYJa0-AVBBoC14AQAvD_BwE">climate change.</a> <br><br>

                    The report looked specifically at the Antarctic Peninsula, which has warmed by
                    a year-round average of 5 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 60 years.<br>
                    There, two species — Adélie and chinstrap penguins — were reported to be in
                    severe decline. Meanwhile, gentoo penguins appeared to be adapting to
                    changing circumstances.</p>
